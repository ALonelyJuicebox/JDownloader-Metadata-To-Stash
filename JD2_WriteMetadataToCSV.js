    Event Script: JD2_WriteDownloadMetadataToCSV
  

    Description
        Based on the writeInfoFile script, this script generates a CSV file in the same location as the downloaded file.
        The information in the CSV file includes the filename, the filesize (in bytes) and the URL used to download the file
        
        In a normal instance where there's just one file in the package, this will generate a single line CSV with the filename, filesize (in bytes) and URL.
        In a circumstance where a JD2 package has multiple files, this will give you a multi line CSV where each line will have a filename, filesize (in bytes) and the respective URL.
        In the event that the URL is undeterminable, the URL field in the CSV will be defined as 'undefinedURL'
                  
    Version: 0.2
 
 Requirements:
    1 - Install the Event Scripter plugin for JDownloader2
    2 - Add this script (making sure to set the trigger to "package finished")


 Tested:
     JD2 on Windows 10/11 (x64) (see path-creation code at the end of this script)
